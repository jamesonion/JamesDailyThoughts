    <h3><u>Who are you?</u></h3>
    <p> Hello, my name is James Nguyen. I grew up in Tampa, Florida and am currently a second-year computer science major at the University of Florida with a passion for learning.
      In my free time, I've been teaching myself web development in order to build this site - hopefully I can add more cool functionality to this site as my understanding of JavaScript grows.
       Outside of coding, I enjoy building computers. I began building computers at age 12 to play Minecraft, funnily enough. As I accrue some money for it, I hope to create a small form-factor desktop
       I can bring with me as I travel. I also like headphones, I currently have a pair of Sennheiser HD6XX's and DT 990 pro's hooked up to a Schiit Modius and Valhalla 2. It follows that I like music, I listen to all genres
       but am currently really digging with experimental electronic pop and alternative Japanese music. Additionally, I love playing basketball recreationally and watching it professionally (Trust The Process!).
    </p>

    <h3><u> What is the purpose of this website? </u></h3>
    <p> Apart from being a personal project to work on my web development skills, I am using this website as a pseudo-blog. Before the new year, I had originally used it to record my dreams
      and subsequently psycho-analyze the events taking place in them. But as I wrote more journal entries, I found the same common motifs among my dreams and the same ensuing personality traits they revealed.
      Given how tiresome it eventually became, I've since changed my "Dream Journal" to a "Joy Journal", where I can now write entries about whatever is bringing me joy - and show off the pictures I take on my phone.
      I hope this activity will help me become more appreciative of the little things in life while ultimately providing an opportunity to one day look back at all these entries and smile.
    </p>

    <h3><u> Do you have any other plans with this blog? </u></h3>
    <p>
      In the future, I may begin writing a column on new music I am discovering or something about the Sixers. Or maybe I'll transform this site into something completely different from a blog, only time will tell.
      Until then, I hope to amass a large collection of memories. : )
