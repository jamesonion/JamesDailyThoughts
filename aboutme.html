  <h3><span> Who Are You? </span></h3>
  <p> Hey, my name is James Nguyen. I'm a sophomore computer engineering student at UF with a particular aptitude for always wanting to share my opinion.
  </p>
  <h3><span>Why Are You Starting a Blog?</span></h3>
  <p> I rarely recall my dreams. But after receiving the suggestion from a friend, I began recording them in the notes app on my phone.
    Much to my surprise, I discovered that my unconcious self is concerningly weird.
    Consequently, as many my age do, I decided to share it with the world (while learning how to code using HTML in the process).
    Consider this blog my Mayflower ship. But rather than bringing colonizers to Native America, I am bringing unwarranted thoughts into your already well-developed mind.
  </p>
  <h3><span> Will You Cover Anything Else in Your Blog?</span></h3>
  <p> At the moment, analyzing my dreams and my unconcious self has been enjoyable and will be the main purpose of this blog.
    Though in the future, as I become better at website development, I do forsee myself addressing more of my passions: music, technology, sports, etc., in the near future.
