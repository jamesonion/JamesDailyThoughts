  <p> Hey, my name is James Nguyen. I'm a sophomore computer engineering student at UF with a particular aptitude for having unconventional ideas and wanting to share said thoughts.
    Consider this blog my Mayflower ship. But rather than bringing colonizers to Native America, I am bringing unwarranted thoughts into your already well-developed mind.
