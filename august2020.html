    <h2> My Dream Journal </h2>
    <p> Where I recount my dreams from the previous night and attempt psycho-analysis the following morning.
      <br> Note* August entries are sparse and possibly inaccurate as I am going back to fill these in from the notes I've recorded on my phone.

    <h3><span class="subheader"> August 24, 2020</span></h3>
    <p>
      I'm in the mall and for some reason it's heavily crowded. No one is wearing a mask, I feel like I'm in the wrong place.
      As my friend and I walk towards a restaurant, we're stopped by a waitress who asks, "Do you have Covid"?
      As a crowd of people begin forming around us, she exclaims "This building is open only for people with Covid"!
      I immediately turn and sprint, trying to find an exit but the mall is endless.
      I'm unaware what my unconcious self is trying to say, victimizing myself because I don't have Covid.
      I'm moving into my apartment near campus in a week, and I imagine the endless landscape of people with Covid is analogous to the undoubtedly many students who will contract Covid returning to campus for the Fall semester.
      I'm worried I will unnecessarily expose myself, and subsequently infect my family.
      I've been trying to justify to myself that I need to leave the house to adequately focus on my studies, but maybe this dream is highlighting the hypocrisy in my logic and my attempts at victimizing myself to justify my own selfishness.
