      <h2> My Dream Journal </h2>
      <p> Where I recount my dreams from the previous night and attempt psycho-analysis the following morning. </p>

      <div class="10/2/2020">
        <h3> <span class="subheader"> October 2, 2020 </span></h3>
        <p> I have a faint fondness for white sauce cheese pizza topped with fresh oysters. It sounds revolting in the morning, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying it.
          From what I remember, my family's Honda Pilot is in the middle of some man's over-the-counter pizza shop. After getting the sibling of the classic white clam pizza,
          I am transported to my apartment. But, for another unknown reason, my computer is in the living room.
          As I try to join a zoom meeting with old friends, I'm constantly interrupted. From either my roommate walking in on me and starting a conversation, or a family membeer calling.
          I end up never getting to participate in the meeting. I am beginning to notice a trend.
          I am constantly dreaming about absurd things, that in the real world would be either unwwanted or outcasted (think of the osyter pizza or the hairless cait, though comparing an osyter pizza to a cat seems in the same sentence is absurd in its own right).
          Again, I am noticing my inability to maintain meaningful connections with people because of how close I am with others, which is pretty ironic.
          I'm unsure how true the latter statement is in regards to my real-life, or the extent of which it is true.
          Though I initially considered the abstractness of the unconcious self as a property that made it impossible to extract any substantial meaning from, I feel I am learning a lot about myself.
          This morning has been full of contradictions and irony.
