    <p class = "date"> 1/18/2021: Beefy Burritos from Taco Bell </p>
    <p class = "entry"> So cheap, yet inconceivably filling. Your homely trove of "seasoned ground beef" lays
    atop a regal bed of yellow rice. A loving drizzle of jalape√±o cheese sauce oozes from your warm crevices. An unassuming, pragmatic, toasted flour tortilla embraces its
    exalted fillings in a manner one can only describe as the epitome of a vessel. Taco Bell's magnum opus, delicately rises from its paper enclosure
    to be adorned by its heavenly crown of Diablo sauce mandated by the divine right of kings. I adore you beefy burrito. </p>

    <p class = "date"> 1/13/2021: Minecraft </p>
    <p class = "entry"> It never ceases to amaze me that I've made friends with people who live across the globe because of video games.
      Despite the time zone difference and not even playing Minecraft anymore, I was able to game with the friends I made on Minecraft back in 2013 for hours today over Discord.
      The internet is a beautiful thing.

    <p class = "date"> 1/12/2021: My Parents </p>
    <p class="entry"> As my spring semester trudges from rest, I find myself still at home due to COVID. If you were to tell me this a month ago, I'd be wholly disheartened.
    But as speculation becomes reality, I am much more grateful of my parents' presence. Eating at the dinner table and asking something as simple as how their day has been,
    I realized just how glad they're still here with me. Let's stay together by Al Green encapsulates my feelings for them perfectly.
