    <p class="entry"> As my spring semester trudges from rest, I find myself still at home due to COVID. If you were to tell me this a month ago, I'd be wholly disheartened.
    But as speculation becomes reality, I am much more grateful of my parents' presence. Eating at the dinner table and asking something as simple as how their day has been,
    I realized just how glad they're still here with me. Let's stay together by Al Green encapsulates my feelings for them perfectly.

      <h2> My Dream Journal </h2>
      <p> Where I recount my dreams from the previous night and attempt psycho-analysis the following morning. </p>

      <div class="10/11/2020">
        <h3><span class="subheader"> October 11, 2020 </span></h3>
        <p> I wake up to find myself in a cramped, yet homely 5th floor New York apartment. I'm late to class.
          I snatch my backpack beside my night stand and hurry down the stairs. With each floor I pass, I see my downstairs neighbors wave to me (this may be the most unrealistic part of my dreams yet, nice neighbors in NYC).
          Soon I've reached some large plaza when I realize I have no clue where my class is (it must be the first day, and I must've skipped orientation). As I ask college-aged bypassers, one tells me to follow them.
          We keep a city pace, before long I stand before some art museum. As I continue behind my unnamed friend, he shows me his work. His work constitutes large bright swirls and Dr. Seuss-like characters (I stare in a proud wonder, unphased by the notion that my friend has their work hanging in a seemingly prominent art museum nor the fact that their work is exactly like Dr. Seuss').
          Eventually, I find myself in a well-lit hall with a spiraling stairwell with no handrails. As I steadily climb down the stairs (the steps are disconnected and nearly a foot away from one another), I realize my class is upstairs (an inexplicable eureka moment considering just a few moments ago I didn't even know where the class' building was).
          Here, the sun morning sun successfully invades my eyes and forces them open. Though nonsensical, it is not too far fetched for me to see that this dream is a representation of my ideal college lifestyle.
          NYC has always been my favorite place to visit in the U.S. The combination of an urban lifestyle (where everything is in walking distance/walking and public services are the preferred method of transportation),
          its cultural density (food, art, communities, etc.) and the cold climate (allowing more self-expression through fashion and favorable weather for walking).
          Additionally, the frequency at which I kept getting distracted while in the city (looking at the art) may be indicative of my sweet disposition towards the arts.
          Though not a newfound realization about myself, I was glad to finally see this fascination being realized in my unconcious self.

      <div class="10/9/2020">
        <h3><span class="subheader"> October 9, 2020 </span></h3>
        <p> Yesterday night was a a concatenation of multiple unrelated dreams, so I'm going to split each dream into their own paragraph. <br>
          1) It begins with me sleeping in my actual apartment bed (I'm teetering between the brink of reality and its becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate the two).
          As my eyes open, I feel sleep paralysis set in. One of my roommates comes in to check on me and announces "he's out".
          Another of my roommates comes in and puts his finger against my neck to check my pulse, I'm trying my best to exclaim that I'm awake but I'm struggling to gain control of my body.
          Inexplicably, he begins serving me a mountain of sweets - piling them atop my counter. As I manage to wiggle and force myself out of bed the scenery changes.
          It's possible that this may be my unconcious self conveying a feeling of helplessness. Coupled with the constant interchanging scenery that depicts the entirety of my night,
          it's possible this was just some foreshadowing of the fragmented dreams that I would later have. <br> <br>
          2) Suddenly, my bedroom moves from an apartment building to an air mattress laying in the middle of a desert (despite this, it's somehow connected to my apartment).
          I succumb to my exhaustion as I begin to lay on the mattress, isolated from the rest of the world. As I close my eyes, the scenery changes again.
          It's possible that this may be my typical response to being overwhelmhed, isolating myself to gain comfort in my own thoughts. <br><br>
          3) Somehow I'm back in the apartment and it seems all of my rooommates' parents, and mine, are staying over.
          The apartment living room is pitch black and there's a tube television in the middle of the room playing some 1970's (I guess this explains the cathode ray TV) capitalistic, American propaganda.
          As I walk past them to pour myself a glass of water from our Brita, I turn back to see their eyes just glued to the televsion. Cue the scenery change.
          The more time I spend analyzing the implications of our economic system and the values that are taught in the public education system, as if they're instrinsic to what it means to be an American, the more critical I've become of it.
          And this is beginning to envelop my thoughts, even when unconscious. <br><br>
          4) Now I'm in a bus, driving across the Southern states. My friend's cousin, who isn't from Florida, is driving the bus - he's anxious about getting pulled over.
          As I look around I see the rest of my friends, huddled between the seats. Soon we hear sirens blaring. We scuttle underneath the seats as the scene ends.
          I've spent some time trying to find any relation to my real life or my personality from this, but I haven't been able to draw up anything yet. Hopefully some eureka moment occurs where I understand this dream and unlock all the hidden mysteries of myself.
          I'll keep mysef updated.

      <div class="10/3/2020">
        <h3><span class="subheader"> October 3, 2020 </span></h3>
        <p> It takes place with my friends and I in an almost empty parking lot in some Southern ghost town. Though I've never seen any part of Gainesville that looks like this, I feel as if I'm there.
          We establish some meeting place as my friend's Toyota Rav 4 blows a storm of dust, cornering onto the highway. As I scan the lot, I can't find my car.
          There's an older gentleman there, grasping the situation, he says I can take the sedan near the entrance (when analyzing my dreams I have to suspend my disbelief).
          As I'm speeding on the barren roads, adrenaline is pumping through me. I take a moment to swerve onto the grass, the frame of the car rumbles but I feel elated.
          I'm losing traction and swerving uncontrollably. All I recall, moments before my car crashes into a ditch, is feeling as light as a feather.
          It's an odd sensation, but one I've begun to notice in my daily life as well. When things are spiraling out of control, there's nothing left worth feeling but pure ecstasy.

      <div class="10/2/2020">
        <h3> <span class="subheader"> October 2, 2020 </span></h3>
        <p> I have a faint fondness for white sauce cheese pizza topped with fresh oysters. It sounds revolting in the morning, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying it.
          From what I remember, my family's Honda Pilot is in the middle of some man's over-the-counter pizza shop. After getting the sibling of the classic white clam pizza,
          I am transported to my apartment. But, for another unknown reason, my computer is in the living room.
          As I try to join a zoom meeting with old friends, I'm constantly interrupted. From either my roommate walking in on me and starting a conversation, or a family membeer calling.
          I end up never getting to participate in the meeting. I am beginning to notice a trend.
          I am constantly dreaming about absurd things, that in the real world would be either unwwanted or outcasted (think of the osyter pizza or the hairless cait, though comparing an osyter pizza to a cat seems in the same sentence is absurd in its own right).
          Again, I am noticing my inability to maintain meaningful connections with people because of how close I am with others, which is pretty ironic.
          I'm unsure how true the latter statement is in regards to my real-life, or the extent of which it is true.
          Though I initially considered the abstractness of the unconcious self as a property that made it impossible to extract any substantial meaning from, I feel I am learning a lot about myself.
          This morning has been full of contradictions and irony.
