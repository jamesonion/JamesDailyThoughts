  <h2> My Dream Journal </h2>
  <p> Where I recount my dreams from the previous night and attempt psycho-analysis the following morning. </p>

      I spent the majority of yesterday trying to tidy up my website's code, so I guess it makes sense I had a dream related to coding.
      In it, I am at a friend's house. With a drink to my left, my laptop is sitting on a rough, lightgray folding table.
      For some unknown reason, I stumble upon my friend's blog site - the same one whom I participated in a hackathon with earlier this year.
      When it opens, I see a split-column layout with drop down menus, the ability to reply to each blog post, and millions of ads (barring the ads, all are features I was hoping to soon implement on my own website).
      As I reach to take a sip of my dirnk, it's taken by a friend who pours it down the sink.
      "Get off your laptop and join us!". I close my laptop and shove my chair into the table when the dream ends.
      I've always thought that imposter syndrome was ridiculous, you should never seriously compare yourself to your peers, but I can't seem to take my own advice.
      My harbored feelings of inadequacy are spurred by my own, unrelenting critique of my productivity.
      I imagine this constant desire to stay productive stems from capitalistic ideals indoctrinated within me by the American public school system.
      Yet, despite my ability to critique said ideals and acknowledge them in myself, I never fail to exhibit them.

      Tonight's dream consisted of the sensation of extreme intoxication. There's sunlight outside, I hear people enjoying themselves in the pool - only a window separating us.
      The sound of a waterproof bluetooth speaker barely pierces the glass. As I step out from my bed, I collapse to the floor (I should start taking iron supplements).
      Inoffensive TikTok songs turn into obnoxious static, white noise. Underneath my desk, there's a kitten.
      It's cowering behind table legs. I try to gesture towards it but I can't, my body is unresponsive.
      The kitten prefers the cold, inanimate, metal legs of my desk rather than risk feeling my warm affection.
      I could continue deciphering what my brain is trying to tell me, but I enjoy surprises.

      I dreamt that I was a kid again. Watching Digimon from my family's cathode ray television.
      It sits proudly atop a cramped wooden closet, now residing as the family TV stand.
      Before my bulbous eyes, a deviant mix between a spear fisherman and a demonic imp.
      I feel nothing but unadulterated happiness.
      With no notion of what is happening around me, I am completely and utterly fixated on the TV.
      That sensation of feeling your grin nudge your cheek, it's becoming more and more foreign.
      In  the grand scheme of things, each passing day is devoted to becoming more adept at attaining a job.
      To then be able to sustain my means for survival. To hopefully attain unadulterated happiness once more.
      To devote the rest of my life to regaining what I had coming into this world.
      It's a decrepit thought, but I can't help but see it as true.
      What a depressing world we live in.
