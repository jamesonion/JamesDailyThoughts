      <p class = "entry"> After finally being back in Gainesville, I began my workout regime again and I was flabbergasted with how weak I am. The discrepancy between my arms
        is nearly comical and seeing myself struggle to work with weights not even 3/4's of what I used to prior was the realization call I needed. Starting at nearly the bottom,
        there is only one way forward from here and I'm excited to chart my progress in the coming months. It's good to be back, even if my aching body doesn't agree. </p>

      <p class ="date"> 2/28/2021: Dungeons and Dragons</p>
      <p class = "entry"> This one is going to be two-parter. The friends whom I attended SwampHacksVII with invited me over to play Dungeons and Dragons.
        I have heard in passing general mentions of what Dungeons and Dragons entails from pop culture. Assuming it would only take a few hours at most, I agreed.
        Unbeknownst to me, Dungeons and Dragons is a much larger time committment (multiple sessions each spanning hours on end). As I sat in their living room, 
        I was thinking to myself "did I really clear my Sunday to role-play as a thieving Dwarf". Yes. Yes, I did. And I actually thoroughly enjoyed myself, a 
        common theme among these stories. From the ridiculousness of crafting a ghillie suit to disguise myself as a patch of grass to sneak past guards to 
        brawling a barely concious drunk after failling to pick pocket him, I found myself fully immersed in the medieval realm my friend had curated. I'm unsure 
        how many times it will take for me to learn this lesson, but it is ultimately about whom you are with rather than what you are doing when it comes to having 
        a good time.</p>

      <p class = "date"> 2/20/2021: McDonalds Pokemon Cards </p>
      <p class = "entry"> I'm jaded that I learned about it so late, but pulling up to a weathered McDonalds drive-thru at 1:30 in the morning while the scent of
        warm chicken nuggets sitting under a heat lamp wafts through the air waiting for your Happy Meal is unmatched. I was so excited in fact I completely forgot about the
        Pokemon cards and got myself a 20 pc, completely forgetting the original intent of my mission. By the time I got home, I already spent an hour slowly circling
        McDonalds' premises. The pack itself felt like cheap paper (akin to a thin slice of cardboard), but the overwhelming wave of nostalgia made it more than worth it.
        Though I didn't pack the card I was hoping for (Piplup), my non-holographic Turtwig lays proudly behind my clear phone case - flaunting the fact that I indeed went to
        McDonalds to get Pokemon cards.</p>

      <p class = "date"> 2/17/2021: One step deeper in the rabbit hole </p>
      <p class = "entry"> Upon coming across an amazing deal for the Topping A90, I decided to finally part ways with my Schiit Valhalla 2 and the headphones that got me into the world of
        headphones (my beloved HD6xx's). I am actively selling them but letting them go in favor of my newer equipment will be a bitter sweet ceremony. During my best and throughout
        my worst, those headphones have accompanied me wherever I've gone - I almost considered holding onto them for keepsake but the emerging necessity to pay rent forced my hand.
        As silly as it is to say farewell to an inanimate piece of technology, I will miss you.

      <p class = "date"> 2/10/2021: Career Showcase </p>
      <p class = "entry"> I've come a long way since freshman year. All I recall from those times when pursuing career-related goals are just overwhelming feelings of 
        dejection and inadequacy. Despite attending every workshop I could find and applying for countless positions, my technical experience lagged behind my peers'.
        As the rejections and "we want to hear from you again next semester"s began rolling in, my self-confidence plummetted. As cliche as it sounds, I wish I could affirm my past self
        to not get too despondent over my internship search. In less than a year's time, I am happy to finally report a successful career fair.  </p>
      
      <p class ="date"> 2/1/2021: Mama Noodles </p>
      <p class = "entry"> It's been a while, but we resumed as if we'd only been apart for a day. Instant ramen. It's always there for you when you need it. Whenever you're at your lowest, it's there to cushion your fall,
      it's there to help you secure ground before you pick yourself back up. It's there when you want to reminisce. There's no better companion.</p>

      <p class ="date"> 1/31/2021: SwampHacks </p>
      <p class = "entry"> I would be lyingg if I said I wanted to attend. Though I had already made prior arrangements, the amount of work I had the weekend of made me overly anxious. Hours before the event, I was thinking to myself
        what would be a suitable excuse I could make to leave. But what ultimately stopped me was the amount of guilt I'd reserve had I quit on my friends (there's no winning when you're pitted against your head). As the event rolled on, I wanted to
        develop a web application but my team wanted to make a desktop game with Python (my excitement for SwampHacks was at an all time low at this point). But as you can probably expect since I'm even posting about it, the experience proved to be
        incredibly fruitful. In the span of 36 hours, I developed a solid grasp of Python's syntax, the intracacies of PyGame (a Python library) and solidified my habit of reading documentation. By the time our submission was due, I felt there was much more
        that we should have finished, but coding with friends made it satisfying in the end. Ultimately, our project ended up winning the award for best themed hack (I was jumping up in down in my room despite my delierous, sleep-deprived state).
        Though I gained tons of programming experience, the biggest thing I took away from the event is my reinforced vigor in leaving my comfort zone. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/28/2021: Loaded Nacho Fries </p>
      <p class = "entry"> I've definitely been putting on some happy weight during the holidays, and my recent experience with Taco Bell's newly released loaded nacho Fries
        presents me with yet another obstacle I will gladly indulge in before returning to a healthy lifestyle. It will be a long time until Taco Bell adds potatoes back to the menu,
        but these are a worthy substitute. The sly red seasoning coating each fry and the disturbingly atomic looking Nacho Cheese culminate in a dish that, *mwuah*, epitomizes
        pulchritude - I imagine Merriam Webster himself is sensually quaking with how I've used the word. Though the majority of the following day was spent on the toilet,
        I cannot assuredly say that the fries were the sole culprit in my unwanted bowel movements so I will reserve any condemning remarks. Please do yourself a favor
        and try them now. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/27/2021: Word of the Day </p>
      <p class = "entry"> I've come a long way from the mental state I was in last semester. Whenever asked about it, I prevaricated about my state of mind. My unending facade blended so well into reality
        I would occassionally convince myself that I was doing fine as well. Though I cannot pinpoint one concrete thing that caused my shift in being (likely my rekindled intimacy with family)
        I can triumphantly say I have a reignited lust to learn. In a meeting for UF's open-source club, one of my friends used the word 'cursory' - I had to google the definiion.
        Rather than be frustrated by my dwindling mastery of diction, I felt inspired to subscribe to a word of the day app. It has been a few days since downloading and I am still keeping
        up with my daily learning goals - rather assiduous of me wouldn't you say? It has been a while, but I'm glad to be me again. </p>

      <p class="date"> 1/24/2021: Joel Embiid </p>
      <p class="entry"> Being a Sixers fan has been a turbelent experience over the past few years. From complete mediocrity to a 50+ win team, the Sixers left me awestruck in 2017. They embodied the essence of the grit and grind underdog
        who claws to the top through pure effort, a story that could inspire anyone. But the following subsequent years left me deflated as we moved countless players around, as we lost the identity we molded through our
        gritty play and settled around the level of play we accomplished in 2017. Though 2021 has only begun, it has heralded the return of the team I remember from years ago. Joel Embiid, the personification of the Sixers and their
        Herculean climb to the top, has resurged. Dropping nearly 40 points a night and the top contender in the East, he has reminded me why I stuck with this team for so long. TRUST THE PROCESS. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/18/2021: Beefy Burritos from Taco Bell </p>
      <p class = "entry"> So cheap, yet inconceivably filling. Your homely trove of "seasoned ground beef" lays
      atop a regal bed of yellow rice. A loving drizzle of jalapeño cheese sauce oozes from your warm crevices. An unassuming, pragmatic, toasted flour tortilla robe embraces its
      exalted fillings in a manner one can only describe as the epitome of a vessel. Taco Bell's magnum opus, delicately rises from its paper enclosure
      to be adorned by its heavenly crown of Diablo sauce mandated by the divine right of kings. I adore you beefy burrito. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/13/2021: Minecraft </p>
      <p class = "entry"> It never ceases to amaze me that I've made friends with people who live across the globe because of video games.
        Despite the time zone difference and not even playing Minecraft anymore, I was able to game with the friends I made on Minecraft back in 2013 for hours today over Discord.
        The internet is a beautiful thing. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/12/2021: My Parents </p>
      <p class="entry"> As my spring semester trudges from rest, I find myself still at home due to COVID. If you were to tell me this a month ago, I'd be wholly disheartened.
      But as speculation becomes reality, I am much more grateful of my parents' presence. Eating at the dinner table and asking something as simple as how their day has been,
      I realized just how glad they're still here with me. Let's stay together by Al Green encapsulates my feelings for them perfectly. </p>
