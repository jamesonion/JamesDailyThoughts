      <p class ="date"> 1/31/2021: SwampHacks </p>
      <p class = "entry"> I would be lyingg if I said I wanted to attend. Though I had already made prior arrangements, the amount of work I had the weekend of made me overly anxious. Hours before the event, I was thinking to myself
        what would be a suitable excuse I could make to leave. But what ultimately stopped me was the amount of guilt I'd reserve had I quit on my friends (there's no winning when you're pitted against your head). As the event rolled on, I wanted to
        develop a web application but my team wanted to make a desktop game with Python (my excitement for SwampHacks was at an all time low at this point). But as you can probably expect since I'm even posting about it, the experience proved to be
        incredibly fruitful. In the span of 36 hours, I developed a solid grasp of Python's syntax, the intracacies of PyGame (a Python library) and solidified my habit of reading documentation. By the time our submission was due, I felt there was much more
        that we should have finished, but coding with friends made it satisfying in the end. Ultimately, our project ended up winning the award for best themed hack (I was jumping up in down in my room despite my delierous, sleep-deprived state).
        Though I gained tons of programming experience, the biggest thing I took away from the event is my reinforced vigor in leaving my comfort zone. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/28/2021: Loaded Nacho Fries </p>
      <p class = "entry"> I've definitely been putting on some happy weight during the holidays, and my recent experience with Taco Bell's newly released loaded nacho Fries
        presents me with yet another obstacle I will gladly indulge in before returning to a healthy lifestyle. It will be a long time until Taco Bell adds potatoes back to the menu,
        but these are a worthy substitute. The sly red seasoning coating each fry and the disturbingly atomic looking Nacho Cheese culminate in a dish that, *mwuah*, epitomizes
        pulchritude - I imagine Merriam Webster himself is sensually quaking with how I've used the word. Though the majority of the following day was spent on the toilet,
        I cannot assuredly say that the fries were the sole culprit in my unwanted bowel movements so I will reserve any condemning remarks. Please do yourself a favor
        and try them now. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/27/2021: Word of the Day </p>
      <p class = "entry"> I've come a long way from the mental state I was in last semester. Whenever asked about it, I prevaricated about my state of mind. My unending facade blended so well into reality
        I would occassionally convince myself that I was doing fine as well. Though I cannot pinpoint one concrete thing that caused my shift in being (likely my rekindled intimacy with family)
        I can triumphantly say I have a reignited lust to learn. In a meeting for UF's open-source club, one of my friends used the word 'cursory' - I had to google the definiion.
        Rather than be frustrated by my dwindling mastery of diction, I felt inspired to subscribe to a word of the day app. It has been a few days since downloading and I am still keeping
        up with my daily learning goals - rather assiduous of me wouldn't you say? It has been a while, but I'm glad to be me again. </p>

      <p class="date"> 1/24/2021: Joel Embiid </p>
      <p class="entry"> Being a Sixers fan has been a turbelent experience over the past few years. From complete mediocrity to a 50+ win team, the Sixers left me awestruck in 2017. They embodied the essence of the grit and grind underdog
        who claws to the top through pure effort, a story that could inspire anyone. But the following subsequent years left me deflated as we moved countless players around, as we lost the identity we molded through our
        gritty play and settled around the level of play we accomplished in 2017. Though 2021 has only begun, it has heralded the return of the team I remember from years ago. Joel Embiid, the personification of the Sixers and their
        Herculean climb to the top, has resurged. Dropping nearly 40 points a night and the top contender in the East, he has reminded me why I stuck with this team for so long. TRUST THE PROCESS. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/18/2021: Beefy Burritos from Taco Bell </p>
      <p class = "entry"> So cheap, yet inconceivably filling. Your homely trove of "seasoned ground beef" lays
      atop a regal bed of yellow rice. A loving drizzle of jalape√±o cheese sauce oozes from your warm crevices. An unassuming, pragmatic, toasted flour tortilla robe embraces its
      exalted fillings in a manner one can only describe as the epitome of a vessel. Taco Bell's magnum opus, delicately rises from its paper enclosure
      to be adorned by its heavenly crown of Diablo sauce mandated by the divine right of kings. I adore you beefy burrito. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/13/2021: Minecraft </p>
      <p class = "entry"> It never ceases to amaze me that I've made friends with people who live across the globe because of video games.
        Despite the time zone difference and not even playing Minecraft anymore, I was able to game with the friends I made on Minecraft back in 2013 for hours today over Discord.
        The internet is a beautiful thing. </p>

      <p class = "date"> 1/12/2021: My Parents </p>
      <p class="entry"> As my spring semester trudges from rest, I find myself still at home due to COVID. If you were to tell me this a month ago, I'd be wholly disheartened.
      But as speculation becomes reality, I am much more grateful of my parents' presence. Eating at the dinner table and asking something as simple as how their day has been,
      I realized just how glad they're still here with me. Let's stay together by Al Green encapsulates my feelings for them perfectly. </p>
