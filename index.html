  <h2> My Dream Journal </h2>
  <p> Where I recount my dreams from the previous night and attempt psycho-analysis the following morning. </p>

    I'm at some family reunion in a dainty wooden cabin. I'm sharing a room with 2 other people whom I never end up seeing.
    My family is gathered around the living room, sitting in antique looking leather recliners, watching a football game (I feel like it's 2009).
    There's a gray hairless cat sneaking around the cabin that takes a liking to me (odd since I've never owned a pet before).
    But as it meanders towards me, I feel myself creeping back into my room. Preferring to hang out with the cat rather than watch the game.
    The dream ends with the two of us snuggling up under my blanket. I've never been able to relate with my extended family much. Whether it be vast age gaps or purely a difference in interests,
    I've been generally opposed to hanging out with them - and I feel this dream is conveying the same emotion. Hairless cats are, to my knowledge, outcasts in the cat realm.
    Maybe the two of us relate to one another, hence the cats liking to me and my decision to discretely snuggle with it in my room rather than watching the game (though I am a big fan of sports).

      I spent the majority of yesterday trying to tidy up my website's code, so I guess it makes sense I had a dream related to coding.
      In it, I am at a friend's house. With a drink to my left, my laptop is sitting on a rough, lightgray folding table.
      For some unknown reason, I stumble upon my friend's blog site - the same one whom I participated in a hackathon with earlier this year.
      When it opens, I see a split-column layout with drop down menus, the ability to reply to each blog post, and millions of ads (barring the ads, all are features I was hoping to soon implement on my own website).
      As I reach to take a sip of my dirnk, it's taken by a friend who pours it down the sink.
      "Get off your laptop and join us!". I close my laptop and shove my chair into the table when the dream ends.
      I've always thought that imposter syndrome was ridiculous, you should never seriously compare yourself to your peers, but I can't seem to take my own advice.
      My harbored feelings of inadequacy are spurred by my own, unrelenting critique of my productivity.
      I imagine this constant desire to stay productive stems from capitalistic ideals indoctrinated within me by the American public school system.
      Yet, despite my ability to critique said ideals and acknowledge them in myself, I never fail to exhibit them.

      Tonight's dream consisted of the sensation of extreme intoxication. There's sunlight outside, I hear people enjoying themselves in the pool - only a window separating us.
      The sound of a waterproof bluetooth speaker barely pierces the glass. As I step out from my bed, I collapse to the floor (I should start taking iron supplements).
      Inoffensive TikTok songs turn into obnoxious static, white noise. Underneath my desk, there's a kitten.
      It's cowering behind table legs. I try to gesture towards it but I can't, my body is unresponsive.
      The kitten prefers the cold, inanimate, metal legs of my desk rather than risk feeling my warm affection.
      I could continue deciphering what my brain is trying to tell me, but I enjoy surprises.

      I dreamt that I was a kid again. Watching Digimon from my family's cathode ray television.
      It sits proudly atop a cramped wooden closet, now residing as the family TV stand.
      Before my bulbous eyes, a deviant mix between a spear fisherman and a demonic imp.
      I feel nothing but unadulterated happiness.
      With no notion of what is happening around me, I am completely and utterly fixated on the TV.
      That sensation of feeling your grin nudge your cheek, it's becoming more and more foreign.
      In  the grand scheme of things, each passing day is devoted to becoming more adept at attaining a job.
      To then be able to sustain my means for survival. To hopefully attain unadulterated happiness once more.
      To devote the rest of my life to regaining what I had coming into this world.
      It's a decrepit thought, but I can't help but see it as true.
      What a depressing world we live in.
