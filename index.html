          I dreamt that I was a kid again. Watching Digimon from my family's cathode ray television.
          It sits proudly atop a cramped wooden closet, now residing as the family TV stand.
          Before my bulbous eyes, a deviant mix between a spear fisherman and a demonic imp.
          I feel nothing but unadulterated happiness.
          With no notion of what is happening around me, I am completely and utterly fixated on the TV.
          That sensation of feeling your grin nudge your cheek, it's becoming more and more foreign.
          In  the grand scheme of things, each passing day is devoted to becoming more adept at attaining a job.
          To then be able to sustain my means for survival. To hopefully attain unadulterated happiness once more.
          To devote the rest of my life to regaining what I had coming into this world.
          It's a decrepit thought, but I can't help but see it as true.
          What a depressing world we live in.
