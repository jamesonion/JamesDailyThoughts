      <h2> My Dream Journal </h2>

          I'm in a large conference room filled with people I've met during my freshman year at college.
          As the meeting ends, the girl sitting beside me grabs my legs and motions we should leave (I don't know her, but I leave the meeting with her anyway).
          Opening the door reveals a giant mall-like hallway. Within seconds I find my room (next door are my suitemates from my freshman year as well, leading me to believe I'm in some giant dormitory).
          The doors for both rooms are wide open, somewhat worrying but I never locked my door (a point of much contention between my suitemates and I) so it doesnt surprise me.
          Stepping in, my room is like a small store in the mall. There are 2 desks for my rommate and I to the side, 3 beds and a king-sized mattress on the floor (I'm unsure why, even as I am writing this now in the morning).
          As the unknown girl and I jump onto the mattress (again, odd choice) my roommates and suitemates reveal themselves from underneath the sheets of the 3 beds.
          Everything in my dream was interconnected, literally within steps of one another. The mall-like structures, the large window panes adorning each room, my life is on full display and completely lacking privacy.
          Though I enjoy how interconnected I am to my friends, it inhibits my ability to show intimacy (or at least, that's what my unconcious self is depicting).
          I'm unsure how much this genuinely applies to me, but my skepticism may just be a result of my unwillingness to acknowledge reality.

        <p> Today's dream was intensely vivid, and longer than usual.
          It's gameday and there's a huge crowd of people from both teams, packed shoulder to shoulder. Suddenly my POV transfers to a reporter in a helicopter, commentating the
          absurdity of having a mass of college students in one stadium during gameday. Half an hour or so passes, the stairs are empty now. And my gut gets the better of my judgement when I return to the stadium.
          The staircases, like a folding bridge, were somehow packed up. I decide to climb a large dangling chain in the middle between flights, undeterred by the impossibility of actually getting up.
          As I am struggling to climb for what seems like a miles of chain, an anonymous girl appears below me and begins pulling on the other end of the chain - I guess it's some form of a pulley.
          I would thank her but my physical abilities are being focused on a more pressing matter.
          As I clutch onto the rails of one of the flights, struggling to heave the lower half of my body over, a burly security guard stops me. Despite obviously tresspassing and being confronted by someone twice my size,
          I feel calm. He escorts me into a room where I see two of my current roommates, who seem to grow increasingly intoxicated as time passes in (why is this a trend in my dreams), and the girl who helped me earlier.
          As we sit in silence for a few moments, an anonymous mom's voice shatters the air as she berates her kid and her friends for smoking. The security guard returns to see my two roommates indiscriminately inebriated and takes them and I away for punishment, despite my sobriety.
          Suddenly, we are transported from the stadium to a beach setting. The guard leaves us with another guard to take care of us, whom lets us off the hook.
          I run to the beach, waddling through the water as I await large waves to dive into - like I did as a kid. As this happens I think I awoke for a few moments and fell back asleep.
          The people in my dream remain the same, though the setting has changed inexplicably. Rather than at the beach, my roommates and I are in the middle of weekend challenge.
          We are racing in a giant red shopping cart with a set of completed maps, I imagine the task at hand, towards some home-base to turn them in. It's night time and our frantic pace signals we're running out of time.
          As we turn onto a wooden, red Japanese-style bridge, the cart suddenly brakes sending us into the ocean.
          With all our belongings wet and the map set ruined, we scramble onto the bridge laughing hysterically.
          Despite how fragmented it was, and nearly impossible to follow, I woke up with a fond memory of the dream. The unending thrill in attempting the impossible, as well as the humility to laugh in the face of failure, brought to me the sensation of innocent, child-like euphoria.
          Though the motif of intoxication in my dreams is unsettling to dwell upon, this dream sequence reminds me that despite no longer being a kid, I still possess the ability to tackle life's challenges and enjoy life as one.

        I'm at some family reunion in a dainty wooden cabin. I'm sharing a room with 2 other people whom I never end up seeing.
        My family is gathered around the living room, sitting in antique looking leather recliners, watching a football game (I feel like it's 2009).
        There's a gray hairless cat sneaking around the cabin that takes a liking to me (odd since I've never owned a pet before).
        But as it meanders towards me, I feel myself creeping back into my room. Preferring to hang out with the cat rather than watch the game.
        The dream ends with the two of us snuggling up under my blanket. I've never been able to relate with my extended family much. Whether it be vast age gaps or purely a difference in interests,
        I've been generally opposed to hanging out with them - and I feel this dream is conveying the same emotion. Hairless cats are, to my knowledge, outcasts in the cat realm.
        Maybe the two of us relate to one another, hence the cats liking to me and my decision to discretely snuggle with it in my room rather than watching the game (though I am a big fan of sports).

          I spent the majority of yesterday trying to tidy up my website's code, so I guess it makes sense I had a dream related to coding.
          In it, I am at a friend's house. With a drink to my left, my laptop is sitting on a rough, lightgray folding table.
          For some unknown reason, I stumble upon my friend's blog site - the same one whom I participated in a hackathon with earlier this year.
          When it opens, I see a split-column layout with drop down menus, the ability to reply to each blog post, and millions of ads (barring the ads, all are features I was hoping to soon implement on my own website).
          As I reach to take a sip of my dirnk, it's taken by a friend who pours it down the sink.
          "Get off your laptop and join us!". I close my laptop and shove my chair into the table when the dream ends.
          I've always thought that imposter syndrome was ridiculous, you should never seriously compare yourself to your peers, but I can't seem to take my own advice.
          My harbored feelings of inadequacy are spurred by my own, unrelenting critique of my productivity.
          I imagine this constant desire to stay productive stems from capitalistic ideals indoctrinated within me by the American public school system.
          Yet, despite my ability to critique said ideals and acknowledge them in myself, I never fail to exhibit them.

          Tonight's dream consisted of the sensation of extreme intoxication. There's sunlight outside, I hear people enjoying themselves in the pool - only a window separating us.
          The sound of a waterproof bluetooth speaker barely pierces the glass. As I step out from my bed, I collapse to the floor (I should start taking iron supplements).
          Inoffensive TikTok songs turn into obnoxious static, white noise. Underneath my desk, there's a kitten.
          It's cowering behind table legs. I try to gesture towards it but I can't, my body is unresponsive.
          The kitten prefers the cold, inanimate, metal legs of my desk rather than risk feeling my warm affection.
          I could continue deciphering what my brain is trying to tell me, but I enjoy surprises.

          I dreamt that I was a kid again. Watching Digimon from my family's cathode ray television.
          It sits proudly atop a cramped wooden closet, now residing as the family TV stand.
          Before my bulbous eyes, a deviant mix between a spear fisherman and a demonic imp.
          I feel nothing but unadulterated happiness.
          With no notion of what is happening around me, I am completely and utterly fixated on the TV.
          That sensation of feeling your grin nudge your cheek, it's becoming more and more foreign.
          In  the grand scheme of things, each passing day is devoted to becoming more adept at attaining a job.
          To then be able to sustain my means for survival. To hopefully attain unadulterated happiness once more.
          To devote the rest of my life to regaining what I had coming into this world.
          It's a decrepit thought, but I can't help but see it as true.
          What a depressing world we live in.
